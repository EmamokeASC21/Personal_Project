    <h1>Computer Science!!!</h1>

            <p>  Computer Science has recently caught my eye in terms of things I may want to pursue in the future and this is one of the main reasons I joined All Star Code. 
                  I’ve had previous experience in coding with other languages like HTML and CSS and I’m looking forward to continuing to enhance my skills in coding.

                I was introduced to this topic of Computer Science by a relative who is now a Computer Science graduate and if I continue this route of Computer Science I will be in a way following his footsteps as well. 
                  I’ve seen some of the stuff that he has been able to create, he recreated Pac Man, he created a Robot that heeds to certain commands, and much more.

        <div class="box">
            <p>Some of these projects, although small, I’m very proud of and fond of because at the end of the day I’m creating something and soon enough I’ll be able to create something that will benefit a plethora of people.

    <h1>Some of My Projects</h1>

       <a href="https://github.com/EmamokeASC21/ASCPROJECTS/blob/main/week1/day5/mash.js" target="_blank"><p>Mash Game </p></a>

       <div id="Mash_container">
        <h3 class="Game">Mash</h3>
        <p class="Game"> This was my first milestone project that I created at my time at All Star Code and it's essentially a fortune telling game that I recreated with code. 
    There are some adjustments I can make to this game so it can function better but overall, I was content with what I was able to do with my first time working with Java Script.</p>
    </div>

    <a href="https://github.com/EmamokeASC21/ASCPROJECTS/blob/main/week2/day5/oop3/sketch.js" target="_blank"> <p>Ping Pong</p></a>

    <div id="Ping_Pong_storage">
        <h3 class="Mini_Game">Ping Pong</h3>
        <p class="Mini_Game">This was my second milestone project that I worked on in my time with All Star Code and it's a simple Ping Pong Game I created with a small group of people. 
        There was definitely more that could be implemented into this project in terms of it's complexity but I'm still proud of what I did in this project.</p>
